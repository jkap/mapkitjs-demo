# MapKit JS demo

this is a simple demo of MapKit JS, the web version of MapKit released to the public during WWDC18!

I've deliberately left this as a simple demo of what's possible. For more detail, check out the [official docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkitjs) and the session ["Introducing MapKit JS"](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/212/)

this was developed by [jae kaplan](https://twitter.com/jkap), maybe go follow her on twitter
